# Digital Clock

This project contains a digital clock implementation using the Tkinter library in Python. The clock displays the current time in a digital format.

## Description

The digital clock application provides a visual representation of the current time in a digital format. The graphical interface is built using the Tkinter library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installation)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/92username/python-learning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the program:
    ```bash
    cd python-learning/apps/clocks/digital
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python digital-clock.py
    ```

## Features

- **Main Window**: The clock window is set to a size of 500x200 pixels with a black background.
- **Digital Clock**: Displays the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format with green text on a black background.
- **Real-time Update**: The clock updates every second to show the current time accurately.

## Example Usage

When you start the program, the interface will display the digital clock. The clock will show the current time and update the display every second.
