# Analog and Digital Clock

This project contains an application that displays both an analog and digital clock using the Tkinter library in Python. The clock shows the current time with hour, minute, and second hands on the analog clock, and with a digital display.

## Description

The analog and digital clock application provides a visual representation of the current time in both analog and digital formats. The graphical interface is built using the Tkinter library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installation)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/92username/python-learning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the program:
    ```bash
    cd python-learning/apps/clocks/digital-analogic
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python digit-analogic.py
    ```

## Features

- **Main Window**: The clock window is set to a size of 400x500 pixels.
- **Analog Clock**: Includes an outer circle, hour markers, and clock hands for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Digital Clock**: Displays the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format at the top of the window.
- **Real-time Update**: Both clocks update every second to show the current time accurately.

## Example Usage

When you start the program, the interface will display both the analog and digital clocks. The clocks will show the current time and update the display every second.
